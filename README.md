# Simple-Shell

Linux (and other Unix like OSes), have **shells** or programs which present a command line interface to users to type commands in.This is a similar basic shell made in C Using fork(), exec() family system calls and wait() family of system calls.


To compile, run the `make` command, and to excecute, run `./code`. 


There are 2 types of commands in Linux Shells :
1. **Internal** : Internal commands are those which are interpreted by the shell program itself, without requiring a different program to handle the expected operations.
2. **External** : External commands on the other hand relate to commands which are not handled directly by the shell program but by an external program.
