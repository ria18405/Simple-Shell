# Simple-Shell

Linux (and other Unix like OSes), have **shells** or programs which present a command line interface to users to type commands in.This is a similar basic shell made in C Using fork(), exec() family system calls and wait() family of system calls.


To compile, run the `make` command, and to excecute, run `./code`.
